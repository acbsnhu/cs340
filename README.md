How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, 
which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project 
Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use 
this CRUD Python module in the future?

To make code that is easily maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I do my best to make
the code easily transferred and modularise it. For example the CRUD module I worte is the same 
module I used for project one. I was able to easily transfer it into the final project because
it was all three of those things making it easy for me to not have to rewrite it and plug it into
a new project. The advantage of working modularly is that it increases production time and creates 
apps that are easily troubleshot and remedied. I can also use this CRUD  module I wrote in all future
project I have that involve database manipluation.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached 
the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did 
your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses?
What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases 
to meet other client requests?

The way I approach a problem as a computer scientist is that I use my critical thinking skills
and situational analysis of the problem. After I have a good understanding of the problem and the
requirments to solve it I am able to interpet solutions and make a descion of what way to move forward.
I kept the same approach throughout this course and didnt change much as I approached each assignment.
Going forward I will continue to use a crud method when working with databases it seemed to work 
very well and was able to be integrated in both this project dashboard and the first project for
this class. I will also continue to deveolope test cases with pass fail metrics for the requirments.


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? 
How would your work on this type of project help a company, 
like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

My best under standing of what a computer scientist does is they use their critical thinking skill
to interpet a problem and find a solution that benifits the user but is able to translate that solution
so that a computer a program can fill that need. They do this by undertanding and interpting a problem and
then testing their solution before implmenting it. This is important because it solves problems for user that
they wouldnt be able to do for themselves and at the same time it can save them time and resources once solutions are implemented.
